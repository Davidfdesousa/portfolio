## Discussions

### Rendering high resolution images
This repo uses retina.js to serve high-resolutions images to devices with retina display. It renders two images per image, one x1 and another x2, it means that the work is left for the browser. This method is not recomended for big sites.  Instead try to serve the right image from the server.

A good article about this is here:

[Retina & Hi-Resolution Displays: The ultimate guide to preparing your websit](https://mercury.one/wordpress/retina-hi-resolution-displays-the-ultimate-guide-to-preparing-your-website/)
